WAIT_TIME_MILLI             -> wait time (in ms) before displaying the next time point in movie-playing mode
INITIAL_ZOOM                -> initial zoom of the subscene in the range [0.0, 24.75] - the higher this number, the
                                farther away the embro is
INITIAL_TRANSLATE_X         -> initial translation (in px) of the camera along the x-axis
INITIAL_TRANSLATE_Y         -> intiial translation (in px) of the camera along the y-axis
CAMERA_INITIAL_DISTANCE     -> initial distance the camera is away from the subscene
CAMERA_NEAR_CLIP            -> distance of the far clipping plane of the camera in the eye coordinate space, from the
                                eye
CAMERA_FAR_CLIP             -> distance of the near clipping plane of the camera in the eye coordinate space, from the
                                eye
BILLBOARD_SCALE             -> scale for the note billboards for visibility and legibility in the subscene
SIZE_SCALE                  -> scale for the radii of the spherical cells
UNIFORM_RADIUS              -> the radius of spherical cells in Uniform Size mode
LABEL_SPRITE_Y_OFFSET       -> vertical offset (in px) of labels from sprites, so they are not rendered on top of
                                each other
DEFAULT_OTHERS_OPACITY      -> initial opacity/visibility in the range [0.0, 1.0] of the "other" subscene entities
VISIBILITY_CUTOFF           -> opacity/visibility in the range [0.0, 1.0] of the "other" subscene entities under which
                                they are not rendered at all
SELECTABILITY_VISIBILITY_CUTOFF     -> opacity/visibility in the range [0.0, 1.0] of the "other" subscene entities
                                        under which they are disabled (not selectable)
STORY_OVERLAY_PANE_WIDTH    -> width (in px) of the story overlay pane in the upper-right-hand corner of the 3D
                                window
NOTE_SPRITE_TEXT_WIDTH      -> wrapping width (in px) of note sprites
NOTE_BILLBOARD_TEXT_WIDTH   -> wrapping width (in px) of note billboards
