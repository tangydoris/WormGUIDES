Note:	The Android and web URLs are currently equivalent.
Note:	URLs are generated using the UTF8 values.
Note:	The "added later" parameters are only added to parsing, not to URL generation. 
		User-facing URL generation currently follows the original API.
		Internal URL generation supports the new parameters.

Search Type:
Lineage 	->	"-s"
Functional 	->	"-n"
Description	->	"-d"
Gene		->	"-g"
Multicell	->	"-m"
Connectome	->	"-c"
Neighbor	->	"-b"

Systematic, Proper		->	-s-n
Description, Proper		->	-d-n
Description, Systematic	->	-d-s
All						->	-d-s-n

Note:	The documentation says that "-g" corresponds to gene search, but iOS only registers a text as
		a gene search if there are no modifiers.
Note:	Currently on the desktop version, we toggle each search type by itself. Multiple search types
		can be toggled on the iOS version.


Modifier:
Cell Nucleus			->	"$"
Descendant				->	"<" (%3E in UTF8)
Ancestor				->	">" (%3C in UTF8)
Cell Body				->	"#" (added later to color cell bodies)
Multicellular Structure	->	"M"

Ex.
Cell, Descendant		->	"<$" (%3E$)
Cell, Ancestor			->	"$>" ($%3C)
Cell Body, Ancestor		->	"#>" (#%3C)
Descendant, Ancestor	->	"<>" (%3E%3C)
All						->	"<$#>" (%3E$%3C)

Note:	The "$" is not used in the Android version. There is ambiguity in whether or not the cell
		modifier is implicitly selected.


Color:
The RGB hex is placed after the search type and modifiers. We append "#ff" (or +%23ff in UTF8) 
followed by the hex value.
