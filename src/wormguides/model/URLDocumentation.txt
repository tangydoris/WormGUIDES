Note:	The Android and web URLs are currently equivalent.
Note:	URLs are generated using the UTF8 values.

Search Type:
Description	-> "-d"
Systematic 	-> "-s"
Functional 	-> "-n"
Gene		-> "-g"

Systematic, Proper		-> -s-n
Description, Proper		-> -d-n
Description, Systematic	-> -d-s
All						-> -d-s-n

Note:	The documentation says that "-g" corresponds to gene search, but iOS only registers a text as
		a gene search if there are no modifiers.
Note:	Currently on the desktop version, we toggle each search type by itself. Multiple search types
		can be toggled on the iOS version.


Modifier:
Cell		-> "$"
Descendant	-> "<" (%3E in UTF8)
Ancestor	-> ">" (%3C in UTF8)

Cell, Descendant		-> "<$" (%3E$)
Cell, Ancestor			-> "$>" ($%3C)
Descendant, Ancestor	-> "<>" (%3E%3C)
All						-> "<$>" (%3E$%3C)

Note:	The "$" is not used in the Android version. There is ambiguity in whether or not the cell
		modifier is implicitly selected.


Color:
The RGB hex is placed after the search type and modifiers. We append "#ff" (or +%23ff in UTF8) 
followed by the hex value.
