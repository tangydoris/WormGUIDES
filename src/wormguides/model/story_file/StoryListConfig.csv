EMS,This is EMS,SPRITE,CELL,,EMS,,,,,,
EMS Divides,"Escaping the rabbit, EMS divides successfully!",SPRITE,CELL,,MS,,,,36,40,no rabbits here
Rabbit Threat!,This is particularly dangerous moment for E,BILLBOARD FRONT,CELL TIME,,E,,,,17,20,you can never trust a rabbit
Safe From Rabbits Now,From this point forward the eggshell is impermeable to rabbits,OVERLAY,,,,,,,40,359,these comments are cool
Nota bene,Lots of cool stuff here.,OVERLAY,,,,,,,,,
