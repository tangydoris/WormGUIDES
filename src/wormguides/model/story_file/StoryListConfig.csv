Neurons depicted express sfGPF driven by the lim-4 promoter. lim-4 expresses in 8 neuronal pairs during mid-embryonic development.,,,,,,,,,,,Mark and Titas,,http://scene.wormguides.org/wormguides/testurlscript?/set/siavr-n$@+%23ff0a84ef/siavl-n$@+%23ff3cee3c/sibdl-n$@+%23ff8221e2/sibdr-n$@+%23ffed2525/rivr-n$@+%23fff8f81d/rivl-n$@+%23ff2eece8/view/time=378/rX=22.375/rY=54.0/rZ=0.0/tX=0.0/tY=0.0/scale=1.75/dim=0.1/browser/Birth of SIBDL,First segmented lim-4 positive cell born,sprite,cell,,ABplppaaaaa,,,,256,256,,,,Birth of SIAVR,lim-4 positive cell,sprite,cell,,ABprpapappa,,,,261,261,,,,Birth of RIVR,lim-4 positive cell,sprite,cell,,ABprpaapaaa,,,,265,265,,,,Birth of SIAVL,lim-4 positive cell,sprite,cell,,ABplpapappa,,,,267,267,,,,Birth of RIVL,lim-4 positive cell,sprite,cell,,ABplpaapaaa,,,,269,269,,,,Birth of SIBDR,lim-4 positive cell,sprite,cell,,ABprppaaaaa,,,,269,269,,,,Detection of lim-4 Expression,This is the first instance when the expression is strong enough to allow for proper segmentation.,overlay,,,,,,,349,349,,,,Neurite Outgrowth of SIAVL Begins,Possibly earlier and not visible till now.,sprite,cell,,ABplpapappa,,,,350,350,,,,Fasicle Formed Between SIAVL and SIBDL,Presence of two cells indicated by striping.,sprite,structure,,lim4_bundle_left,,,,357,360,,,,Lim-4 expression is found in 8 neuron pairs,This story highlights development of 3 of those 8 pairs,overlay,,,,,,,363,373,,,,Neurite Outgrowth of RIVL,fist visible outgrowth,sprite,cell,,ABplpaapaaa,,,,364,364,,,,Nerve Ring Closure Complete,Occurs between comma and 1.5 fold stages of development.
