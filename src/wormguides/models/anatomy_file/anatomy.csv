ASH,Sensory,lateral ganglia,amphid sensilla (dendrite) and ventral cord;amphid commissures; nerve ring (axon),bipolar (sensory dendrite and axon); runs in the middle of the nerve ring, ciliated; polymodal; mechanosensory; osmosensory; odersensation,glutamate
RIB,Interneuron,lateral ganglia,ventral cord; amphid commissures; nerve ring (axon),branches near sub-dorsal and sub-ventral process bundles from the labial sensilla,Integration of information from outside and inner state; second layer interneuron,*
AVG,Interneuron,Retrovesicular ganglion of head,doral region of the cord,single interneuron; large process that runs to pre-anal ganglion; enters the dorso-rectal ganglion and runs down dorsal hypodermal ridge to tip of the tail.  Hypothesized to be a sensory dendrite,pioneers the right tract of the ventral cord; guidepost neuron,*
DD,motor neuron,ventral cord,ventral (dendrite/postsynaptic) and dorsal cord (predominantly presynaptic/axon) in adults; reverse in first larval stages,short posterior; long anterior neurites, locomotion ,GABA
DA,motor neuron,ventral cord,ventral (dendrite/postsynaptic and anteriorly directed processes); dorsal cord (presynaptic/axon),innervate dorsal muscles,Backwards locomotion,Acetylcholine
RIVL,polymodal (interneuron and motor neuron),subdorsal lateral ganglia,nerve ring,enter the ring sub-dorsally; cross over to the contralateral side of the ring; and then run round it in the middle of the neuropile, locomotion ; local search behavior,*
RIVR,polymodal (interneuron and motor neuron),subdorsal lateral ganglia,nerve ring,enter the ring sub-dorsally; cross over to the contralateral side of the ring; and then run round it in the middle of the neuropile, locomotion ; local search behavior,*
SIAVL,interneuron; motorneuron,ventral ganglion,nerve ring; ventral cord; amphid commissure; sub-lateral cord,unusual in that it appears to have no synaptic outputs except; perhaps; via gap junctions to RIB,unknown,Acetylcholine
