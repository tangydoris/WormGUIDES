Development of Early Nerve Ring Neurons,Depicts the development of early nerve ring neurons from birth to nerve ring closure. Neurons depicted express sfGPF driven by the lim-4 promoter. lim-4 expresses in 8 neuronal pairs during mid-embryonic development.,,,,,,,,,,,Mark and Titas,,http://scene.wormguides.org/wormguides/testurlscript?/set/rivl-n$@+#ffff9966/rivr-n$@+#ffffe6b4/sibd-n$@+#ffe6ccff/siav-n$@+#ff99b3ff/view/time=343/rX=18.25/rY=29.0/rZ=0.0/tX=0.0/tY=0.0/scale=3.0/dim=0.25/browser/
